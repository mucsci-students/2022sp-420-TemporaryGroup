1. MVC - The UML Editor uses model, view, controller components. For example, we have a diagram MODEL named
UMLEditor.java, a CONTROLLER named CliController.java, and a VIEW named CLIView.java.

2. Builder - Classes/Objects such as the UMLCLass.java is composed of the field class, method class, and 
parameter class. 

3. Observer - The Jline3 line reader observes change in the command line interface for the user input and 
notifies the tab completer. 

4. Chain of Resposibility  - When a user types exit in the CLI, the input handler passes the request further
and then prompts the user for a yes (y) or no (n). If the input is something other than that then the controller 
has to handle it. 

5. Memento - The undo and redo stacks in UMLDiagram.java function as a memento pattern. The diagram itself acts as
an originator with an internal state and the stacks keep track of memento objects, or snapshots of the diagram.

6. Prototype - The prototype design pattern is used in UMLDiagram.java in undo and redo. The clone method is
used to make a deep copy based off the current state of the diagram for use in the stacks.

1. MVC - The UML Editor uses model, view, controller components. For example, we have a diagram MODEL named
UMLEditor.java, a CONTROLLER named CliController.java, and a VIEW named CLIView.java.

2. Builder - Classes/Objects such as the UMLCLass.java is composed of the field class, method class, and 
parameter class. 

3. Observer - The Jline3 line reader observes change in the command line interface for the user input and 
notifies the tab completer. 

4. Chain of Resposibility  - When a user types exit in the CLI, the input handler passes the request further
and then prompts the user for a yes (y) or no (n). If the input is something other than that then the controller 
has to handle it.
